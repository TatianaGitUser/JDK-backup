23.5 Difference between http and https

HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) and HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) are both protocols
used for communication over the internet, but they differ primarily in terms of security.

Here are the key differences between HTTP and HTTPS:

    Security:

        HTTP: It is the standard protocol for transmitting data over the internet. However, it is not
        secure. Data transferred via HTTP is sent in plain text, which means that it can be intercepted
        and read by malicious actors.

        HTTPS: It is a secure version of HTTP. It uses encryption to protect the data being transmitted.
        This encryption is typically provided by SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) or its successor,
        TLS (Transport Layer Security). When you visit a website using HTTPS, the data exchanged between
        your browser and the web server is encrypted, making it much more difficult for unauthorized
        parties to intercept and decipher.

    Data Integrity:

        HTTP: It does not provide data integrity features, which means data can be altered or tampered
        with during transmission without detection.

        HTTPS: It includes data integrity checks. If any data is altered during transmission,
        the receiving end will detect it and reject the compromised data.

    Authentication:

        HTTP: It does not provide a strong means of authenticating the server or website you're
        connecting to. This lack of authentication can make userDomainForDataTables vulnerable to phishing attacks or
         Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks.

        HTTPS: It uses digital certificates to authenticate the identity of the server or website you're
        connecting to. This helps ensure that you're communicating with the legitimate website and not
        an impostor.

    Port:

        HTTP typically uses port 80 for communication.

        HTTPS typically uses port 443 for secure communication.

    URL Scheme:

        HTTP URLs begin with "http://."

        HTTPS URLs begin with "https://."

In summary, HTTPS is a more secure version of HTTP that provides encryption, data integrity, and
authentication mechanisms to protect the privacy and security of data transmitted over the internet.
In today's web environment, it is strongly recommended to use HTTPS for websites and applications to
safeguard user data and maintain trust and security in online interactions.
