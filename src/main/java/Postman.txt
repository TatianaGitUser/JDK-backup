23.3 What is Postman?

Postman is a popular collaboration platform for API development that simplifies the process of designing,
testing, and documenting APIs (Application Programming Interfaces). It provides a user-friendly interface
that allows developers to make HTTP requests to various APIs, view responses, and automate testing and
monitoring of APIs. Postman is used by developers and teams to streamline API development and testing
processes. Some key features of Postman include:

    API Testing: Postman allows userDomainForDataTables to create and run tests on APIs, ensuring that they work as
    expected. You can set up automated test suites to check the functionality and performance of your APIs.

    API Documentation: It enables you to generate and share API documentation that includes detailed
    information about endpoints, request parameters, response examples, and more.

    Collections: Postman allows you to organize your API requests into collections, making it easier
    to manage and share sets of requests and tests.

    Environment Variables: You can define environment variables to store values that can be reused
    across requests, making it easy to switch between different environments (e.g., development,
     testing, production).

    Collaboration: Postman offers collaboration features, allowing team members to work together on API
    development, testing, and documentation.

    Mock Servers: You can create mock APIs in Postman to simulate endpoints and responses, making it
    possible to test and develop APIs even before the actual backend is implemented.

    Monitoring and Automation: Postman provides options for scheduling and automating API tests,
    monitoring API performance, and alerting you if issues are detected.

Postman is widely used in the software development industry to streamline the API development process,
improve API testing and quality, and facilitate collaboration among developers and teams working on
API-related projects. It is available as a desktop application and as a web-based platform, and it
offers both free and paid subscription plans.
