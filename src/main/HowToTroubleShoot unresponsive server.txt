22.17 How to troubleshoot unresponsive server

When a Linux server becomes unresponsive, it can be a cause for concern. Troubleshooting such
situations requires a systematic approach to diagnose and resolve the problem. Here are steps to follow
when your Linux server is not responding:


1. Check Network Connectivity:

    Ensure that the server is still connected to the network.

    Check for network issues, such as cable connections, router or switch problems, and network
    service availability.

2. Physical Access:

    If possible, access the server physically to check its status.

    Check for any hardware issues, including power supply, overheating, or malfunctioning components.

3. Remote Access:

    If you have remote access to the server (e.g., through SSH), try connecting to it.

    If you can connect but the server is slow or unresponsive, proceed to diagnose software issues.

4. Monitor Resources:

    Use system monitoring tools like top, htop, or sar to check CPU, memory, and disk usage.

    Look for any resource-hungry processes that may be causing the unresponsiveness.

5. Review Logs:

    Examine system logs, such as /var/log/messages, /var/log/syslog, or application-specific logs,
    for any error messages or warnings that might provide clues.

6. Test Disk Space:

    Ensure there is enough free disk space on the server. A full disk can lead to unresponsiveness.

    Use the df command to check disk space.

7. Examine Running Processes:

    List running processes using the ps or top command to identify any stuck or resource-intensive
    processes.

    You can use the kill command to terminate problematic processes.

8. Check for Memory Issues:

    Use the free command to check memory usage.

    Consider checking for memory leaks in running processes.

9. Network Issues:

    Check the server's network configuration.

    Verify DNS and routing settings.

    Use the ping command to check network connectivity to external resources.

10. Firewall and Security: - If you're using a firewall, check for misconfigurations that might be
blocking connections. - Investigate possible security incidents, such as DDoS attacks.

11. Reboot the Server: - If you've tried all the above steps and still cannot resolve the issue,
consider rebooting the server as a last resort. This may help if the problem is related to temporary
software issues.

12. Contact Support: - If you are still unable to resolve the issue or suspect a hardware problem,
contact your hosting provider or hardware support for assistance.

13. Preventive Measures: - Implement monitoring and alerting tools to proactively detect and address
issues before they cause server unresponsiveness. - Regularly update and patch your server to address
software vulnerabilities. - Implement redundancy and backup solutions to ensure server availability.

Remember to document your actions and observations as you troubleshoot.
This information can be valuable in case you need to seek external help or review the incident
in the future. Additionally, it's essential to have a plan for disaster recovery and server
maintenance to minimize downtime and data loss in the event of a server failure.
